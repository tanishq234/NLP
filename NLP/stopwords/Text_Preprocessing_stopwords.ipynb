    "Paragraph=\"\"\"Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, popularly known as A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, was one of India’s most respected scientists and the 11th President of India. Born on October 15, 1931, in the small town of Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, Kalam came from a humble background. His father was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque, and despite financial hardships, Kalam was a bright student with a strong passion for learning. His early life was marked by discipline, simplicity, and a deep curiosity about science and flight. After graduating in physics from Saint Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli, he went on to study aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology. His determination and hard work laid the foundation for a life of extraordinary achievements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Kalam began his career at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and later moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he was the project director of India’s first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III), which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in orbit in 1980. This was a major milestone in India’s space program. Known for his significant contributions to India’s missile development programs, Kalam was instrumental in developing the Agni and Prithvi missiles, earning him the nickname “Missile Man of India.” His work in defense technology elevated India's position on the global stage and strengthened national security. He also played a pivotal role in India’s nuclear tests conducted at Pokhran in 1998, which made India a nuclear power.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2002, Dr. Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India and served from 2002 to 2007. As President, he was admired across political lines for his integrity, simplicity, and vision for the country. He often referred to himself as the \"People's President\" due to his accessibility and connection with citizens, especially the youth. He strongly believed that the youth were the backbone of a nation and could shape its destiny through knowledge, innovation, and moral values. His books, especially Wings of Fire, Ignited Minds, and India 2020, have inspired countless young minds to dream big and serve the nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even after his presidency, Dr. Kalam remained deeply committed to education, innovation, and youth development. He continued to travel extensively across India, addressing students and motivating them to pursue excellence with a strong sense of national pride. He advocated for a developed India that is self-reliant in technology, education, and infrastructure. His life was a perfect example of how dedication, hard work, and humility can lead to greatness. On July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Dr. Kalam collapsed and passed away, doing what he loved most—interacting with students. His death was mourned by the entire nation. Today, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam remains a symbol of perseverance, inspiration, and patriotism, and his legacy continues to inspire generations of Indians to dream big and work tirelessly to turn those dreams into reality.\"\"\"\n",
